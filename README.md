# K2 ADO.NET Helper

## Introduction

The current dynamic Service Broker provides functionality to enable various ADO.NET queries and return the list of items in a standard way. One of the frequent applications of the ServiceBroker can be:
- populate listing controls and views (DropDowns, List Views, ListBoxes etc.) with distinct items;
- refresh the populated Listing controls and hide the values, selected in another control (e.g. SELECT * FROM SMO WHERE Prop1 NOT IN(Val1, Val2...));
- complex joins, which are enabled with ADO.NET queries;

For more details and detailed instruction on how to configure it, please, refer to the documentation below.
